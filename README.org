#+TITLE: On which we may reflect

How to learn?

1. Learn the right things (search for orthogonal skills that spans a space where
   you want to have impact)
2. Learn fast with a rapid feedback loop
3. Reflect & introspect on process and intent

...

I want to be able to explain this to people. And I want to iterate on it myself.
I'll need some slides. And I'll want to edit those slides structurally, probably
with Org-mode. And I'll want to /run/ the resulting slides. Probably in a sci
context like scittle.

(That's actually a case for where sci-in-sci makes sense)

But ... how do I want to handle it? Produce static HTML, then enrich it? With
hooks, perhaps? Do I want to produce multiple files? I think I want to control
that with EDN data.
